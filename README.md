# ModWinder Repository

 This is a repository for ModWinder and other small things, mostly relating to Ladysnake projects.

## ModWinder

 Simple project to bring back a dead mod

 This mod was originally created by the people at [Ladysnake](https://github.com/ladysnake).
 Their website at [ladysnake.glitch.me](https://ladysnake.glitch.me/) also has an old, outdated version at [oldladysnake.glitch.me](https://oldladysnake.glitch.me/) which contains the [file](https://oldladysnake.glitch.me/milksnake-bar-v2) that I have taken here. I have decided since it is no longer available at the host, I am attempting to modify LadyLib to jump off of the JSON file [here](/milksnakebar.json) for the list of mods.

### Mods

 See the [mod list file](/modlist.md) to see a list of mods currently shown.

 Edited LadyLib available for source building or jar downloading at [my fork of it](https://github.com/sschr15/LadyLib)

## Gaspunk

### Info

 There used to be a purely aesthetic feature in Gaspunk where certain people could get certain benefits. This is actually a pretty cool idea, but like ModWinder, it broke when Ladysnake got a new site. All the old content was on the old site but wasn't moved. I am tasking myself to support the custom skin availability by adding the list to this site.

### Download

 The download is available in the mods folder.
