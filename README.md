# ModWinder
 Simple repository to bring back a dead mod

 This mod was originally created by the people at [Ladysnake](https://github.com/ladysnake)
 Their website at [ladysnake.glitch.me](https://ladysnake.glitch.me/) also has an old, outdated version at [oldladysnake.glitch.me](https://oldladysnake.glitch.me/) which contains the [file](https://oldladysnake.glitch.me/milksnake-bar-v2) that I have taken here. I have decided since it is no longer available at the host, I am attempting to modify LadyLib to jump off of the JSON file [here](/milksnakebar.json) for the list of mods.
